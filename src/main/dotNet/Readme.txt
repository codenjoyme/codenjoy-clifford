1) Register on http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest (to get your name)
2) Open Loderunner.sln in VS2010.
3) Open file "Program.cs" from "Demo" project.
4) Find line 11. It looks like:

	var game = new MyCustomAI("ApiDotNet");
5) Replace "ApiDotNet" with your name, you got on step #1
6) Now you can run Demo :)
7) All "game logic" is in the class "MyCustomAI" in method "DoMove()"
